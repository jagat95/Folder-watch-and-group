# Folder-watch-and-group
This script can watch a folder and move the files within that into separate folders grouped by file name pattern match

Mainly my use case was to look at game bar screenshots folder and move the files based upon game names into separate respective folders.

Example: 
Mortal Kombatâ„¢ 11 6_18_2023 1_20_21 PM.png -> Mortal Kombatâ„¢/*
Cyberpunk 2077 (C) 2020 by CD Projekt RED 12_2_2023 12_58_01 AM.png -> Cyberpunk 2077 (C) 2020 by CD Projekt RED/*
Overwatch 2023-04-17 00-33-48.mp4 -> Overwatch/*
[Stray]   3_19_2023 3_36_19 PM -> [Stray]/*
